#
# Every PVM graph node has the following fields:
#
# @id::
#   a Neo4j database ID
#
# @id::
#   a unique ID that will be the primary ID for the graph node
#
# @label::
#   a longer human-readable string for display in lists and graph
#   (e.g., a file path or a process' command line)
#
# @short_name::
#   a name that is short and ideally human-meaningful, but which is not
#   necessarily unique
#
# @style_name::
#   used by graphing code to look up, e.g., icons
#
# @properties::
#   a set of raw named properties from the database â€” these can be presented
#   to the user for interpretation but are not necessarily interpreted by the
#   UI itself
#
# In addition to these, subclasses of PvmNode add fields that are relevant to
# the type. For example, Process objects have a @pid (process ID) field.
