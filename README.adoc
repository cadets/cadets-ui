# CADETS UI

This is a prototype for the CADETS/OPUS UI implemented with only JavaScript,
HTML and CSS.


## Getting started

### Install dependencies

This UI depends on:

[horizontal]
http://neo4j.com[Neo4j]::
Graph database to hold
https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/fresco/opus[OPUS] provenance graph

https://www.npmjs.com[npm]::
https://nodejs.org[Node] package manager

Start by installing these tools with your system's package manager
(https://debian-handbook.info/browse/stable/sect.apt-get.html[apt-get],
https://chocolatey.org[Chocolatey],
https://brew.sh[Homebrew],
https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/pkgng-intro.html[pkg], …).
All other dependencies are installed using `npm`:

```terminal
$ npm install
⸨        ░░░░░░░░░░⸩ ⠦ fetchMetadata: sill mapToRegistry uri https://registry
[...]
> node lib/post_install.js

added 594 packages in 5.621s
```


### Get OPUS data and start Neo4j

In order to visualize OPUS provenance data, you will need a running Neo4j
instance containing a graph database. Describing this process is out of scope
for the UI, but we hope to have some public instructions to link to soon.
Once you have a graph database in an appropriate place
(e.g., `/var/db/neo4j/databases/graph.db`),
start running Neo4j:

```terminal
# neo4j start
Active database: graph.db
Directories in use:
  home:         /usr/local/neo4j
  config:       /usr/local/neo4j/../etc
  logs:         /var/log
  plugins:      /usr/local/lib/neo4j/plugins
  import:       /usr/local/neo4j/import
  data:         /var/db/neo4j
  certificates: /usr/local/etc/neo4j-certificates
  run:          /var/run
Starting Neo4j.
Started neo4j (pid 93067). It is available at http://localhost:7474/
There may be a short delay until the server is ready.
See /var/log/neo4j.log for current status.
```

You can check that Neo4j is running correctly by visiting
http://localhost:7474/.
Ensure that you can connect to the database (`:server connect`);
the first time you connect you will need to choose a database password.


### Build and run demo UI

We use https://webpack.js.org[Webpack] to manage our scripts and style
definitions together with their JavaScript dependencies.
You can build our code using the `webpack` command from the
`node_modules/.bin` directory:

```terminal
$ ./node_modules/.bin/webpack
Hash: 9ceef271a6cb69f75a20
Version: webpack 3.10.0
Time: 81ms
    Asset     Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
bundle.js  33.9 kB       0  [emitted]  main
   [0] ./js/module.js 31.5 kB {0} [built]
```

The compiles our JavaScript files together with their dependencies into an
optimized and "minified" file called `bundle.js` and transforms images into
cache-friendly (but human-unfriendly) names like `1531d[…]2af.svg`.
This content is optimized for serving quickly via the Web rather than debugging.
A more developer-friendly way to build the assets is `webpack-dev-server`,
which compiles unoptimized versions of JavaScript and recompiles them whenever
the source files change and serves them from http://localhost:8080:

```terminal
$ ./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server
Project is running at http://localhost:8080/
webpack output is served from /
[...]
webpack: Compiled successfully.
```
