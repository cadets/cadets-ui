### Dependencies:
* Node
* npm

### Build from source
To build the web application, do
```
make npm
```
This is needed the first time to install all node package dependencies.
After modifying any source files, simply running `make` or `make all` is enough.

After the build, start the web server by running
```
./run
```
and visit the website in your browser (in the default config,
http://localhost:8080)
