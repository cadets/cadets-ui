note left: Functions to build queries,\npossibly using user-provided filters:

note "fileQuery:\nname:\nname substrings that have been used to refer to this file\nuuid:\nopaque UUID for the file" as N1

note "neighbours:\nLook up a node's immediate neighbours" as N2

note "processQuery:\nLook up processes in the database according\nto a set of filters:\ncmdline:\nsubstring within the command line that executed the process\nuuid:\nopaque UUID for the process" as N3
Connection .. N1
Connection .. N2
Connection .. N3

class Query
{
	{field} +driver
	{field} +log
	{field} +varname
	{field} +matchExpr
	{field} +parse

	{method} +execute: (total, result, complete, limit = 200)
	
}
note right: A query that can be executed and\nwhose result set size can be\nreported in O(1) time.

note "execute:\nThree callbacks should be provided:\ntotal:\ncalled first, with a total number of nodes that match the\nresult:\ncalled with each node that arrives (in a stream of nodes)\ncomplete:\ncalled when transfer is complete" as N4
Query .. N4
